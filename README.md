### Hi,

I'm Josh Britain, a third year computing science student.

### I have experience in

- OpenGL Shader Development, specifically writing shaders for the Minecraft mod Iris.
- Python, doing just about anything.
- Docker, deploying web apps and assembling server stacks that the word "monstrosity" cannot begin to describe.
- 'Modern' Web Development, with frameworks such as Next.js and Svelte.
- 'Traditional' Web Development - Using Jekyll or Nunjucks (with express.js) for templating and writing CSS and HTML directly.
- Desktop application development in Java.
- Game development in Godot.

### I'm interested in

- Computer graphics (shaders in particular)
- Web development (both front and backend)
- Embedded systems
